# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

We commit to 99.95% monthly uptime for production services.

An SLA breach occurs if total unplanned downtime exceeds 22 minutes in a calendar month,
or if a single continuous outage lasts longer than 15 minutes.

In the event of an SLA breach, customers are eligible for service credits based on internal policy.
